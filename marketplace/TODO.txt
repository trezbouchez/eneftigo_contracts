DONE: 1. Keep track of (next)collecton ID in NFT
DONE: 2. Only add FPO if make_collection succeeds
DONE: 3. Should fpo include asset_url? maybe just link to the collection?
Accept proposal - take into account that ordering of acceptable_proposals is now changed
Delete collection on offering conclude if no NFTs have been sold
fpo_conclude need to refund proposers for their storage and price deposits
Check attached gas and terminate early if insufficient to ensure we have enough for rollback just in case
Same with deposits. This may reduce the probability of a rollback
If running out of gas, will already-created Promises be executed? This is a problem f.ex. for refunds initiated early in the contract call execution!
What if there's already another bid for this account?
